# Yew Choose
Yew Choose is a React-based website for a wedding celebrant, designed to showcase their services and portfolio in a beautiful and engaging way. The website features a responsive layout, a hero section with a video background, a portfolio section with a customizable image gallery, and a call-to-action section with a booking form. Created for my Mum's wedding celebrant business, Yew Choose.
